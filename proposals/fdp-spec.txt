0. Preliminary

	The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.

1. Overview

	This document specifies the FreeDomo Protocol

2. Roles

	The cornerstones of the FDP network are nodes, who MUST have at least
	one role. Currently the following roles are available:

	- MASTER
	- SLAVE
	- INPUT
	- OUTPUT
	- SENSOR
	- ACTUATOR

2.1 MASTER role
	
	Every FDP network MUST have exactly one MASTER node. The MASTER node
	MUST NOT have any other roles in the network.

	It is the sole task of the MASTER node to guard network integrity and
	accept new nodes into the network.

	The MASTER node also decides on the Network Identifier (NID), which
	acts as an addressing prefix for all nodes in the network.

2.2 SLAVE role

	An FDP network MAY have one or more SLAVE nodes. A SLAVE node MAY
	assume the role of MASTER once it has established that the original
	MASTER has failed and it is still able to contact over 50% of the
	original FDP network.

	A SLAVE node MUST receive a complete view of the network from the master
	on a regular basis, so it may perform role assumption properly

2.3 INPUT role

	A node that has an INPUT role is able to handle human input and MUST send
	this input to the paired node, or in it's absence the upstream for safe
	keeping.

2.4 OUTPUT role

	A node that has an OUTPUT role is able to display data in a
	human-interpretable way. Typical examples are LCD screens, indicator
	lights, etc. 

2.5 SENSOR role

	A node that has a SENSOR role is able to sense it's surroundings and
	MUST report this back to the requestor, or in it's absence the upstream 
	for safe keeping. 

2.6 ACTUATOR role

	A node that has an ACTUATOR role is able to take an action that
	influences the fysical surroundings of the node. A light illuminates,
	a garage door opens the door.
